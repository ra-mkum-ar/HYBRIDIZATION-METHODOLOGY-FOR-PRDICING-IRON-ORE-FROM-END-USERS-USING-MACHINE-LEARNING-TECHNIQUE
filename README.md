To develop innovative technology to analyses the various levels of mines while also ensuring the tracking of raw minerals from mines to endpoints. 

‚û¢ A smart system that monitors the transport and movements of various types of minerals from mines 
     to endpoints. 

‚û¢ Prevention of leakage of iron ore while transporting .

‚û¢ To classify the iron ore types with manpower using laboratory testing  is low accuracy.

‚û¢ The misclassification of types of iron ore with other mineral types.

‚û¢ One of the most popular and widely used variants of the R-CNN family is the faster R-CNN.
‚û¢ A specific search algorithm based on CPU calculations is used to suggest areas and takes seconds (or 
     seconds) per image. 
‚û¢ RPN (Region Proposal Network), which creates region proposals and reduces the per-frame generation time 
     from seconds to milliseconds, is used in faster R-CNNs .


‚û¢ A new technique called YOLO (You Only Look Once) makes it possible for a picture to anticipate 
     items and their locations after only one look. 
‚û¢ For instant object identification, neural networks are used. To instantly complete the target

     detection regression and predict the position of the bounding box and the class of the candidate 
     box, the entire framework needs only to use a reasonably basic CNN structure. 
‚û¢ To predict the bounding boxes and determine the class probability to label the boxes, YOLO 
     focuses on the whole image. To achieve its goals, it predicts a finite number of bounding boxes.
‚û¢ It achieves twice the overall average accuracy  of previous object classifiers and can 
     classify objects at up to 155 FPS (fps) in real time.
